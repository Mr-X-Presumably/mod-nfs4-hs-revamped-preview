<h2>About This Mod</h2>
This is a fully revamped version of Need for Speed 4: High Stakes (PC) with the engine maximum of car additions, and consistency fixes with said additions; updated graphics and texture fixes for most tracks; fixes, gameplay additions, improved soundtrack, and more; and all without taking away a single iota from the vanilla experience.

<h2>List of Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Improved texture sets for nearly all tracks, as well as new modder-made models for <b>all</b> cars</li>
  <br />
  <li>Improved modder-made asset implementations, with fixes by me for various inconsistencies, including (but not limited to) missing vidwalls, upgrades, interiors, showcases, color names, performance, sound, damage modelling, driver models, traffic models, etc. to make everything fit in seamlessly into the vanilla game</li>
  <br />
  <li>Improved soundtrack for all non-original racing music tracks</li>
  <br />
  <li>Altered mostly useless interface buttons to allow editing opponents' cars and difficulty before races</li>
  <br />
</ul>

<h2>Note</h2>
Because probably 80% of the new assets introduced by this mod come from other modders without their permission, forks, downloads, and pull requests will <i>not</i> be permitted.
